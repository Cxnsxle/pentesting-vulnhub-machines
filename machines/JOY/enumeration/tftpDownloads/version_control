Version Control of External-Facing Services:

Apache: 2.4.25
Dropbear SSH: 0.34
ProFTPd: 1.3.5
Samba: 4.5.12

We should switch to OpenSSH and upgrade ProFTPd.

Note that we have some other configurations in this machine.
1. The webroot is no longer /var/www/html. We have changed it to /var/www/tryingharderisjoy.
2. I am trying to perform some simple bash scripting tutorials. Let me see how it turns out.
